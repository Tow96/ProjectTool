# Project Tool App

This is an extremely over engineered app that allows a user to set up an active projects folder and an inactive projects folder.

The Inactive folders get zipped and stored for ease of backing up.

The application uses an Angular frontend and a NestJS backend that serves as an API, as well as the static html file server
